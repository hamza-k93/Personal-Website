    <h1>About Me</h1>
        
    <p>I’m currently a Data Scientist at Meta based in San Francisco. 
        Before that, I was a Product Analyst at Turo. I am a graduate of 
        UC Berkeley (Go Bears!) where I studied Mechanical Engineering and
        self-taught myself Computer Science.</p>

    <p>I learned my craft by working on side projects with friends and 
        guidance from great mentors. In my free time, I love watching Formula 1
        and get my hopes up for Lewis Hamilton winning another championship!
        I’m currently learning Machine Learning Engineering, and blogging
        about my favorite books.</p>

    <p>I'm inspired by people who seek personal growth and happiness!
        If that sounds like you, let's grab some chai (tea).</p>
